**Python Libraries Used :**
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. streamlit --> for app deployment
4. matplotlib 

**Workflow:**
1. Data Collection:
    Historical stock data is stored in a structured format, with columns such as:
        Date
        Open

    Handle missing or inconsistent values.    
    Ensure data types are appropriate for analysis.
    Normalize or scale data as needed.


3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode).

4. Insights Generation:
    Identify periods of high volatility.
    Determine the highest and lowest stock prices over the dataset's time range.
    Evaluate the average trading volume.
